# [Project 1 - Database Modelling](/github.com/parvinnabili/project1.git)

This is a project I did for one of my courses as a part of my Master's degree, where I had to build an entire database system from scratch and run some queries to derive insights. For this particual project, I built a database system for a bank to manage its financial services for individual and corporate clients.  The ultimate goal of the project was to design a robust and scalable database system that can provide accurate and timely information for decision-making and customer service purposes.

* All the data used for this project was generated by myself, without utilizing any pre-existing databases. 
* The database was designed to allow clients to open multiple bank accounts and conduct various transactions through them, including loans and deposits.
* The database supports the bank's organizational structure, with several branches, each with multiple departments and employees in different categories.
* Database system is designed for various users, each with varying levels of access and privileges.
